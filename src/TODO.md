All upgrade & skill cost: tech \$425~\$655, mines ~\$100*5, general ~\$150/\$300. ~\$1000+ in total. Should be able to be achieved before round 200.

All mines are upgraded => $30/turn => one test per ~3 turns

- [x] Main general taking armies to closest unconquered oil well.
- [x] Greedy upgrading strategy. (mine prod > general prod > swamp tech > others, def randomly stop)
- [x] After all upgradings are done, move major troops into center 5*5 area and do some random moving.
- [x] Everytime we get ~\$100 we apply skills randomly.
